I grew up in argriculture my whole life picking and packing watermelons since the day I could lift and sling them around. My family and I experienced modern technology take the place of labor workers. For example, my sister and I used to appy the stickers to each watermelon getting packed and shipped around the world to your local wal-mart and publix locations; I must of applied more than a million stickers in my life-time until a company came up with a air compressed sticker applicator that did the job more efficently then what we could do on our best day. All I needed to do was reload the applicator when the roll of stickers was finished. I became very intrested on this invention that saved me from the hundreds of paper cuts I suffered throughout the years and it peaked my intrest to understand how it actually came to function, little did I know my admiration into computer systems and information technology grew. Innovations keep coming one after another making the average labors job either obsolite or eaiser, this is the main reason I embarked on a path of computer systems and information technolody to understand and modify jobs in technology weather it be troubleshooting issues or installing hardware components. My goal is to make everyones job easier because of technology, I understand now that progress and change is inevitable and I never could of imagined how it would change my life for the better all those years ago when I slapped that first Melon-1 sticker on that watermelon in my hometown of Immokalee in the summer of 99'.
